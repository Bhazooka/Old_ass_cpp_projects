After recent heavy rains, the water level in three of Utopia's major dams are recovering from a major drought.  Write a system that will allow the department of water affairs employee to capture the current water levels.  Since all the dams are of unequal size, each dam contributes a specific weight towards the overal state of water supply in Utopia.  This means that the operator must also assign a weight towards each of the dam levels. The sum of the weights must equal one.  If the weight does not equal one, the program may exit with an error.

Calculate the weighted average of the three dams.
Assign a status level to the overal water supply status given the following ranges:
[0 - 60):  LOW
[60 - 80): MEDIUM
[80 - 100]: HIGH

Using the status level as an indicator, output the following information to the operator:
LOW: "The water supply is currently low"
MEDIUM: "The water supply is currently medium"
HIGH: "The water supply is currently high"

As an afterthought, if the water level is LOW then output a water saving tip: "Rather shower", if not output: "Have long baths"
