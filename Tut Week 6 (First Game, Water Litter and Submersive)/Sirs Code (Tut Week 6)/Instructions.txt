Objective:
 1) Using and creating user-defined libraries.
 2) Declaring and implementing functions in a namespace.
 3) Using fixed length arrays.

The Utopian deep see cleaning company needs your help in training employees.  The training simulator needs a program that teaches employees how to pilot a deep-sea submersible to collect waste at different sea levels.  The training simulator should comply with the following requirements:
 1) Simulate 20 possible sea levels, from very shallow to extremely deep.
 2) 5 Pieces of litter gets positioned randomly in the 20 levels. (The simulator may put more than one piece of litter in the same level)
 3) The submersible is placed randomly in one of the 20 levels.  If the submersible starts in a place where a piece of litter has been placed, then the submersible automatically collects the litter.
 4) A pilot should have the possibility of moving the submersible up and down the levels.
 5) When the submersible moves over the litter, it automatically collects the litter.
 6) The simulator should have a screen that clearly shows the sumbersible, the 20 levels and the current location of the litter.
 7) The simulation ends when all pieces of litter has been collected.

The solution must make use of functions declared and implemented in a user-defined library.  All functions must be created in the LitterSpace namespace.
