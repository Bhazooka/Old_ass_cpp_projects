Create a game that creates a dynamically sized world, given the number
of rows and collumns from a command-line parameter.

The aim of the game is for the player to move freely in the world
without getting caught by the computer.

The player can only move up,down,left and right.
The player cannot move across boundaries.

The computer can move to any of the ajacent cells, including diagonal movements, but cannot cross boundaries.

As soon as the computer gets to within a predefined range,
the computer senses the player and starts to chase the player.

Scattered throughout the game are 10 magical items.  When you collect all 10 items, the game ends and you are a winner.

The game ends when the computer catches the player.
