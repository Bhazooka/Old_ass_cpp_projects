This week we have a variant of the chaser game that we created before.  We will be making use of structs and enums.  To following changes now exist.

Initialisation.
The size of the game and the detection range of the enemy is specified using a command line argument.
Every empty space has a 10% chance containing a rock boulder.
The escape portal appears in a random location in the top right quadrant of the game world.
The player starts in random location in the the bottom left quadrant of the game world.

Movement.
The player can move up, down, left and right.
The player can not move over a boulder.

Update.
The enemy will move in a random direction as long as the player is outside the enemy's detection range.
The enemy will try and move towards the player when the player is within the enemy's detection range.
The enemy may only move into empty areas or the area occupied by the player.

End game.
The game ends in success when the player reached the portal.
The game ends in failure when the player is caught by the enemy.
